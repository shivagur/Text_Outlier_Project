first thing s first what i had understood till now is created a new git repo in my github account and included a .gitignore one liscense file and readme file and then i had cloned that repo in my local pc.

next what i had done is opened that project in vs code and created a template.py file for the project setup purpose....

so in that file included all the necessary files including for deployment also like .github/workflows etc files and wrote a python script which reads through the files and creates files.

so by running the template.py file we were able to setup our project files from scratch clean and neat and then committed the changes to github

git add.
git commit
git push...

Now we need to create a virtual env

conda create -n textsummarizer python=3.9 -y {{{command for creating a virtual env}}}


now after creating virtual env opened the requirements,txt file and whatever libs are necessary wrote them amd at the ende wrote ....... -e. which sets up the 


Next in the setup.py file just wrote my username , project name as per the github repo credentials and then done...

Now we need to run the requirementest.txt file to able to install all packages needed for our project...

after successfully installing all packages then i had committed the files to github.....
